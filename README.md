# Sparkify_Capstone_Project-Apache_Spark-AWS_EMR-
The full dataset is 12GB, of which you can analyze a mini subset in the workspace on the following page. Optionally, you can choose to follow the instructions in the Extracurricular course to deploy a Spark cluster on the cloud using AWS or IBM Cloud to analyze a larger amount of data. Currently we have the full 12GB dataset available to you if you use AWS. If you use IBM, you can download a medium sized dataset to upload to your cluster.

Details on how to do this using AWS or IBM Cloud are included in the last lesson of the Extracurricular Spark Course content linked above. Note that this part is optional, and you will not receive credits to fund your deployment. You can do the IBM portion for free. Using AWS will cost you around $30 if you run a cluster up for a week with the settings we provide.

Once you've built your model, either in the classroom workspace or in the cloud with AWS or IBM, download your notebook and complete the remaining components of your Data Scientist Capstone project, including thorough documentation in a README file in your Github repository, as well as a web app or blog post explaining the technical details of your project. Be sure to review the Project Rubric thoroughly before submitting your project.
